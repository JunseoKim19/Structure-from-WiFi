# Structure-from-WiFi

With the rising prominence of WiFi in common
spaces, efforts have been made in the robotics community
to take advantage of this fact by incorporating WiFi signal
measurements in indoor SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping) systems, termed WiFiSLAM. This paper describes
recent work in the development of WiFiSLAM systems and
addresses the challenges currently faced in achieving WiFibased mapping used in typical SLAM applications. A discussion
of the usage of alternative WiFi-based systems is conducted,
with a focus on the field of research into k-visibility. We
introduce the novel concept of an inverse k-visibility algorithm
and its application in using a free-space prediction model to
achieve geometric mapping of an environment. A suggested
approach to build upon this model is given, with simulated and
experimental results implemented to demonstrate the proposed
inverse k-visibility-based approach
